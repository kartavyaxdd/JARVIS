It is designed to simplify your daily routine by automating repetitive tasks, providing information, and assisting with various actions. This readme file contains instructions on how to set up and use Jarvis on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started with Jarvis, make sure you have the following:

2. Navigate to the cloned directory: `cd jarvis`
3. Install the required Python packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Configuration

After installation, you need to configure Jarvis by setting up your API credentials and password. Follow these steps:

1. Open the `api.txt` file in the `jarvis` directory.
2. Replace the `API_KEY` and `API_ENDPOINT` placeholders with your actual OpenAI API key and endpoint, respectively.
3. Save and close the `api.txt` file.

Next, you need to change the default password for Jarvis. Follow these steps:

1. Open the `password.txt` file in the `jarvis` directory.
2. Replace the `PASSWORD` placeholder with your desired password.
3. Save and close the `password.txt` file.

Note: It's important to keep your API credentials and password secure and not share them with anyone else.

## Usage

Once you have configured Jarvis, you can start using it by running the `jarvis.py` script. Follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal window and navigate to the `jarvis` directory.
2. Run the `jarvis.py` script: `python jarvis.py`
3. Jarvis will prompt you to enter the password that you set in the `password.txt` file.

Jarvis can perform a variety of tasks, such as generating text, answering questions, providing information, taking screenshots, sending WhatsApp messages, telling jokes, sending emails, flipping a coin, remembering things, playing YouTube videos, performing Google searches, Wikipedia searches, and much more. You can communicate with Jarvis by typing commands or questions in the terminal, and Jarvis will respond accordingly.
